abstract = {The present table contains experimental root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radii R obtained by combined analysis of two types of experimental data: (i) radii changes determined from optical and, to a lesser extent, Kα X-ray isotope shifts and (ii) absolute radii measured by muonic spectra and electronic scattering experiments. The table combines the results of two working groups, using respectively two different methods of evaluation, published in ADNDT earlier. It presents an updated set of rms charge radii for 909 isotopes of 92 elements from 1H to 96Cm together, when available, with the radii changes from optical isotope shifts. Compared with the last published tables of R-values from 2004 (799 ground states), many new data are added due to progress recently achieved by laser spectroscopy up to early 2011. The radii changes in isotopic chains for He, Li, Be, Ne, Sc, Mn, Y, Nb, Bi have been first obtained in the last years and several isotopic sequences have been recently extended to regions far off stability, (e.g., Ar, Mo, Sn, Te, Pb, Po).}

abstract = {Parity-violating electron-scattering experiments represent an important focus of the nuclear physics experimental program at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab. These experiments pose significant challenges because the scattering asymmetries can be very small, of the order parts-per-million and smaller. To succeed, the properties of the electron beam such as current, position, size and energy, must be very nearly identical in the two electron-polarization spin states (parallel and anti-parallel relative to the direction of beam motion at the scattering target). This paper describes the origins of unwanted helicity-correlated beam asymmetries present on the electron beam and methods to minimize them to acceptable levels.}
