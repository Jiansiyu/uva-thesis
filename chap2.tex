\chapter{The Theory of PRex Experiment(~20)}



PRex experiment measures the neutron skin thickness with parity violation asymmetry. This chapter will introduce the theoretical aspect of the experiment. weak interaction, weak interaction form factor, APV, and neutron skin thickness.

\begin{itemize}
    \item history of the nuclear structure
    \item scatter is used for nuclear structure probe, charge radius 
    \item neutron charges 0, poorly measured
    \item historical measurement 
    \item parity violation measurement of the neutron density
\end{itemize}

The RMS radius of the  neutron distribution in a heavy nucleus  $R_N$ provides an important test of nuclear theory. Furthermore,   $R_N$ is used in the determination of  the density dependence of symmetry energy of neutron-rich matter; this dependence is an  important input in   neutron star structure, heavy iron collision, and atomic parity violation experiment calculations. In the past hadron scattering experiments with pion, proton or anti-proton beams have been used to determine the neutron radii of heavy nuclei. However, these measurements suffer from uncertainties associated with the probe particle and the target nucleus. Electron scattering provides a model-independent probe of nuclear radii.  However, in electron scattering, the measurement of neutron distribution in a nucleus  is much harder than the measurement of the proton distribution  since the neutron is uncharged.

\section{Theory background of the PRex experiment}
[Add derive Mott cross section]

The Charge distribution of nuclei is measured by electron scattering. The cross-section can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega_{Mott}}|F_p(Q^2)|^2
\end{equation}

Here is the equation the first part $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega_{Mott}}$ is the Mott cross-section with describes the cross-section of electron scattering over a point-like charged particles. The second part is the form factor of the charged particle which contains the structure information of the particle. 


\begin{equation}
    F_n(Q^2) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int{j_0(qr)\rho_n(r)}d^3r
\end{equation}

In low $Q^2$ approximation, the form factor can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    F(Q^2) = \int{(1-i\Vec{Q}\Vec{r} - \frac{1}{2}(\Vec{Q}\Vec{r})^2)\rho(\Vec{r})}d^3r = Q_e - \frac{1}{6}Q^2<r^2> + ...
\end{equation}

\section{Parity Violation Weak interaction}
\subsection{Helicity and Chirality}
\subsection{parity}

In particle and nuclear physics, interactions are described by fundamental forces that are mediated by exchange particles, known as bosons. For a long time, it was believed that all fundamental interactions conserved parity, meaning that the laws of physics remained unchanged under spatial inversion. However, this assumption was challenged by the discovery of parity violation in weak interactions in the 1950s.

[add T.D. Lee and Yang's work]. The groundbreaking experiments by Chien-Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 demonstrated that weak interactions, responsible for processes such as beta decay, do not conserve parity. This discovery led to the revised understanding that while electromagnetic and strong interactions conserve parity, weak interactions do not. The recognition of parity violation has had a profound impact on the development of the Standard Model of particle physics and continues to shape research in fundamental physics.

Parity plays a significant role in the classification and understanding of particle and nuclear states. In particular, the determination of parity quantum numbers and their conservation (or violation) in various physical processes has provided important insights into the nature of interactions and symmetries.

\subsection{weak interaction}
[into to 4 forces, and its mediators]

There are four fundamental forces governing the universe: strong force, weak force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force. These forces vary in terms of their relative strengths and ranges. Among them, gravity is the most feeble, yet its influence is unbounded, extending infinitely. In contrast, the electromagnetic force, while also limitless in range, is significantly stronger than gravity. The strong and weak nuclear forces operate within a limited range, primarily influencing interactions at the subatomic level. Despite its name, the weak nuclear force is more potent than gravity but pales in comparison to both the electromagnetic force and the strong nuclear force. The strong force, as the name suggests, is the strongest of all four fundamental interactions.

The interaction of three of these fundamental forces—strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic—relies on the exchange of force-carrier particles, classified more broadly as bosons. These particles facilitate the transfer of discrete energy units between matter particles. Each fundamental force has a respective boson: the strong force is transmitted by gluons, photons carry the electromagnetic force, and W and Z bosons mediate the weak force. The corresponding boson for gravity, hypothetically, is the graviton, although its existence remains unconfirmed.

Unlike the photon and gluons, the weak force intermedia W and Z boson are extremely heavy. 

\begin{equation}
    M_w = 80.40 \pm 0.03 GeV/c^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    M_z = 91.188 \pm 0.002 GeV/c^2
\end{equation}

Three of the fundamental forces result from the exchange of force-carrier particles, which belong to a broader group called “bosons”. Particles of matter transfer discrete amounts of energy by exchanging bosons with each other. Each fundamental force has its own corresponding boson – the strong force is carried by the “gluon”, the electromagnetic force is carried by the “photon”, and the “W and Z bosons” are responsible for the weak force. Although not yet found, the “graviton” should be the corresponding force-carrying particle of gravity. The Standard Model includes the electromagnetic, strong and weak forces and all their carrier particles, and explains well how these forces act on all of the matter particles. However, the most familiar force in our everyday lives, gravity, is not part of the Standard Model, as fitting gravity comfortably into this framework has proved to be a difficult challenge. The quantum theory used to describe the micro world, and the general theory of relativity used to describe the macro world, are difficult to fit into a single framework. No one has managed to make the two mathematically compatible in the context of the Standard Model. But luckily for particle physics, when it comes to the minuscule scale of particles, the effect of gravity is so weak as to be negligible. Only when matter is in bulk, at the scale of the human body or of the planets for example, does the effect of gravity dominate. So the Standard Model still works well despite its reluctant exclusion of one of the fundamental forces.
